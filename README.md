## The Spark of an Idea: The Expert's Dilemma
Every expert, consultant, and trainer holds a universe of knowledge within them, forged through years of experience, challenges, and triumphs. Yet, this invaluable expertise often remains unstructured—a brilliant but scattered collection of insights locked away in CVs, documents, and the corridors of memory. The path from being a master of a craft to becoming a mentor for the next generation is fraught with hurdles: How do I build a personal brand? How do I structure my knowledge into a compelling course? How do I communicate my value effectively?

This is the dilemma **GalaxyEd** was born to solve. It is not just another tool; it is an AI alchemist, designed to transmute the raw material of your experience into a structured, marketable, and impactful digital legacy.
